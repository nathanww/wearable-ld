CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH  
TITLE OF RESEARCH STUDY: Learning, Creative Problem-Solving, REM Sleep, and Dreaming (Establishing two-way communication between an actively dreaming subject and an observer: Inside the Mind of the Dreamer; Illuminating the Dreamer's Perceptual Experiences; and Testing levels of control in laboratory induced lucid dreams) 
INVESTIGATOR: Ken A. Paller, PhD 
SUPPORTED BY: This research is supported by the National Science Foundation, the BIAL Foundation, and the Psychology Department. 
KEY INFORMATION ABOUT THIS RESEARCH STUDY: 
The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether to be a part of this study. Information that is more detailed is listed later on in this form. 
The purpose of this study is to investigate encouraging lucid dreams as part of our larger project to attempt two-way communication between a dreaming participant and an observing researcher. You will be asked to download an Android phone app that will use sound cues to teach reality testing techniques that may make lucid dreaming easier.  On the days that you chose to participate, you will be asked to complete optional online questionnaires about your recent and/or typical sleep habits and experiences. Those nights, before bed you will activate the app, set the volume level, and complete a brief training protocol (less than 30 minutes). You will place the phone on your bed and leave the app running overnight. The phone will play a type of white noise in the background and may play other sounds at points during the night. Whenever you awaken from a dream, at your expected wake time or for another reason, then you will be asked a few questions by the app. If time remains before your scheduled wake time, then you may return to sleep. You are welcome to participate on as many or as few nights as you care to. The app will not operate after June 2023, so your participation will end at that point at the latest. But you can pause, stop, or even delete the app before then if you like. We appreciate your completing any forms or questionnaires but they are not required and you are free to complete just what you decide each time. 
The primary risk of participation is possible sleep disruption during the week of the study. The main benefit is advances in our understanding of how the brain works. We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. 

WHY AM I BEING ASKED TO TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY? 
We are asking you to take part in this research study because you have reported sleep qualities that we seek: duration; dream recall; and ability to fall back asleep after wakening. 

HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE IN THIS STUDY? 
We expect about 500 people will be in the larger paid research study (a mix of in-person and remote experiments), 100 Psychology Department Subject Pool participants, and an additional 3000 will be available on this volunteer portion of the project for a total of up to 3600 subjects. 

WHAT SHOULD I KNOW ABOUT PARTICIPATING IN A RESEARCH STUDY? 
∙ Someone will explain the research study to you 
∙ Whether or not you take part is up to you. 
∙ You can choose not to take part. 
∙ You can agree to take part and later change your mind. 
∙ Your decision will not be held against you. 
∙ You can ask all the questions you want before you decide. 

WHAT HAPPENS IF I SAY, “YES, I WANT TO BE IN THIS RESEARCH”? 
If you agree to participate in this study, you will be assisted in loading the Android App onto your own phone via the Google Play store. The App uses Android's internal firewall (the "permission model") to explicitly prevent the app from getting any personally identifiable or private information, so the app is prohibited by the firewall from reading texts, getting user location, etc.--the only things it can do are to guide you to the questionnaires and to read and write files on the internal storage which it uses for log files and sends back to our lab. 
You will be trained in the use of the App, which is designed to teach you some simple “reality testing” techniques associated with specific sounds. For example, you may hear a chime and will learn to perform a “reality check” to see whether you are dreaming. After reaching a deep sleep, sounds may play softly over the phone. If, for example, you hear the chime in you sleep, you may realize you are not awake and become lucid in your dream. 

WHAT HAPPENS IF I DO NOT WANT TO BE IN THIS RESEARCH? 
Participation in research is voluntary. You can decide to participate or not to participate. 
  
WHAT HAPPENS IF I SAY “YES”, BUT I CHANGE MY MIND LATER? 
You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you. You will not need to explain your withdrawal. Data collection will be stopped at that point. All data collected up until that point will remain anonymous and will not identify you in any way.  

WHAT HAPPENS TO THE INFORMATION COLLECTED FOR THE RESEARCH? 
Efforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB and other representatives of this institution. 
De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research community at large to advance science and health. We will remove or code any personal information that could identify you before files are shared with other researchers to ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to identify you from the information we share. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee anonymity of your personal data. 

WHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO KNOW? 
Compensation: If you agree to take part in this research study, you will not be paid.  This aspect of the research is purely voluntary for participants interested in lucid dreaming.  

WHO CAN I TALK TO? 
If you have questions, concerns, or complaints, or think the research has affected you in some way, talk to the research team.
